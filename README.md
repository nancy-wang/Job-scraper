# Job scaper project for Health Leads
Note: This code was adapted from: https://github.com/Futvin/Web-Scraper-in-Python-with-BeautifulSoup. 
This is a web scraper/crawler which grabs all of the current jobs from Indeed, based on search urls.  This will 'click' on the Next button until there are no more jobs to grab.  This utilizes the BeautifulSoup4 3rd party package.

Usage
--------------
Currently must compile .py file to run the job search. 


Dependances
--------------
Python 3.5: These scripts were developed against Python 3.5.

BeautifulSoup 4: You will need to install BeautifulSoup in order to run these libraries.
  Here is a link to the specific version that I used for this project:
